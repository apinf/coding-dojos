## Retrospective

### üòÑ

* Everybody got a turn
* Team got baby steps
* Nice
* Work with python (learn new language)
* Everyone took a turn.
* Very short but still good perspective of how people think.
* Learning from each other
* Possibility to learn how other people think while solving certain problem
* Team got baby steps

### üôÅ

* The tools need to be familiar in order to avoid loss of time
* Other watching without saying anything
* Time passes too fast
* Editor
* 5 minutes is too short to form coherent thoughts and convert them to code. Especially when someone's turn starts in the middle of someone else working
* Strugle with editor and laptop
* Editor and keyboard layout caused delays

### üí°

* More time for pilot round
* Monthly coding dojos

### ‚ùì

* What did you expect?
* Simpler way to host a dojo? (E.g. without a computer?)
* How it is determined when Dojo is ready?
